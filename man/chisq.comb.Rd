\title{Combine categories for a chi-square goodness of fit test}
\usage{
chisq.comb(chisq.test, combine)
}
\arguments{
\item{chisq.test}{The output of a chi-square goodness of fit test by functions \code{chisq.bin}
or \code{chisq.Pois}.}

\item{combine}{A vector with the numbers of the categories to combine.}
}
\value{
It returns a table with the contribution to the chi-square statistic for each category,
the chi-square statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the p-value.
}
\description{
This function combines categories for a chi-square goodness of fit test.
}
\details{
This function only cobines categories on the extremes.
It is recommended to combine categories when the expected counts are too low.
As a rule of thumb, the chi-square approximation for the test statistic can be unreliable
if some categories have expected counts smaller than 5 or if there is any with an expected
count smaller than 1.

\examples{
x <- 0:6
f <- c(334, 369, 191, 63, 22, 12, 9)
output <- chisq.bin(x, f, n = 10)
# Combine categories 5, 6, and 7
chisq.comb(output, combine = c(5, 6, 7))
